# Smart-Shutdown

Features:

- Countdown timer.

- Ability to Pause, Abord and continue the countdown.

- Shutdown using windows shutdown window.

- Shutdown based on network traffic (Download).

- Force shutdown (Time has to be more than 1sec).

Application will minimize to system tray and continue selected action.

Note: 

- If you close the application with timer counting down your system will not shutdown. The countdown will be aborted.

- If you close the application with windows counting down, not the application you can use the application to abort the shutdown.
 
TODOs:

- Implement ability to drag the window around the screen as borderless windows require addition functions.
